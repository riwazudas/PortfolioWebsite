  about:
    "Software developer with a strong foundation in computer science and engineering, shaped by hands-on experience at Byjus and academic training at Vellore Institute of Technology. Passionate about building intelligent systems at scale using AI, NLP, computer vision, and cloud technologies.",
  aboutMore:
    "My interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and real-world autonomy â€” exploring how models in NLP, computer vision, and decision-making can work together to create smarter systems. I've built scalable backend architectures using Golang and Java Spring Boot, deployed on AWS, and contributed to production-ready services with performance and cost optimizations. I enjoy working across the stack, from infrastructure to ML applications, and thrive in collaborative environments that value learning and innovation.",
